Hello there! My name is Thomas, and you can reach me at thomeven@gmail.com. I retired from work in April 2022 at the age of 62, and I'm absolutely passionate about wildlife photography. In my retirement, I spend my days cherishing time with my two daughters and grandchildren, pursuing my photography dreams, developing macOS applications, and exploring the breathtaking Norwegian mountains and nature.

# Nature

From a young age, I've had a deep love for nature. Photography has been another of my favorite hobbies for many years. But I'm also deeply concerned about the challenges facing nature and wildlife. It's heartbreaking to see that many politicians don't seem to understand the importance of protecting these ecosystems. I've come to realize how fragile nature is and how all living beings are connected. Humans have a tendency to destroy nature through ignorance and economic incentives, and it fills me with worry.

# Sony gear

For the past 6-7 years, I've only used Sony gear. My Sony gear includes:

- Sony full-frame A1 mkii camera body
- Sony FE 600mm F4.0 GM OSS lens
- Sony FE 300mm F2.8 GM OSS lens

# Photo formats

I only shoot RAW formats with my Sony camera. In post-processing, I make only basic adjustments and reduce noise if I shoot by high ISO in low light conditions. The Zeiss Secacam takes pictures in JPG only. My post tools are DXO PL 8 and Affinity Photo.

# How are these pages built?

Hugo, a static site generator, is the web framework that builds these pages. The source code for this website is on GitHub. Netlify, the web server, automatically detects changes to the main branch and quickly rebuilds the server. The Hugo theme I use is [FixIt](https://github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt), another open-source project hosted on GitHub. When I make changes or add things to pages, I commit these changes to GitHub, and Netlify builds the new server in seconds.
