**These pages are under development**.



Hello there! My name is Thomas, and you can reach me at thomeven@gmail.com. I retired from work in April 2022 at the age of 62, and I'm absolutely passionate about wildlife photography. In my retirement, I spend my days cherishing time with my two daughters and grandchildren, pursuing my photography dreams, developing macOS applications, and exploring the breathtaking Norwegian mountains and nature. *All photos and videos within this pages are taken by me.*

# Important

Although I am not an avian expert, my experience observing the Hen harrier has provided me with some deeper understanding of the species. While much of my knowledge is derived from reading literature and research, my personal observations by photo have been particularly valuable. Over the past four to five years, I have dedicated myself to photographing birds, which has enhanced my knowledge and appreciation of these magnificent creatures. 

Observing the Hen harrier has been an immensely rewarding and intellectually stimulating experience. 

But, I am still a **novice** regarding knowlegde about birds and birding.

# Birds of prey

This website is dedicated to a few birds of prey that I've spotted either near my home or at my cabin in the mountains. Some of these birds are even seen both at home and at my cabin. My home is in Vestfold, close to the Oslo Fjord, and my cabin is about 1000 meters above sea level in the beautiful valley of Hallingdal. Both my home and cabin are located in Southern Norway.

I have also include some photos of the White-tailed eagle, photographed in Western part of Norway. The White-tailed eagle is the largest bird of prey in Norway. And it is really huge.

# Nature

From a young age, I've had a deep love for nature. Photography has been another of my favorite hobbies for many years. But I'm also deeply concerned about the challenges facing nature and wildlife. It's heartbreaking to see that many politicians don't seem to understand the importance of protecting these ecosystems. I've come to realize how fragile nature is and how all living beings are connected. Humans have a tendency to destroy nature through ignorance and economic incentives, and it fills me with worry.

# Sony gear and Zeiss Secacam 5 trail camera

For the past 6-7 years, I've only used Sony gear. My Sony gear includes:

- Sony full-frame A1 mkii camera body
- Sony FE 600mm F4.0 GM OSS lens
- Sony FE 300mm F2.8 GM OSS lens

This year, I bought a Zeiss Secacam 5 trail camera. Some of the videos of the Hen Harrier that I've taken are actually from the Zeiss.

# Photo and video formats

I only shoot RAW formats with my Sony camera. In post-processing, I make only basic adjustments and reduce noise if I shoot by high ISO in low light conditions. The Zeiss Secacam takes pictures in JPG only. My post tools are DXO PL 8 and Affinity Photo. Both are excellent tools. For video processing, I use the free version of Davinci Resolve, which is also great.

I'm quite new to shooting video. The Sony movies are 100p, 4K video, and the shutter speed is 1/200s, following the 180-degree rule. The picture profile is Sony S-Log3. In Davinci Resolve, I apply the Color Space Transform from S-log3 to Rec.709. The videos from the Zeiss Secacam are normal mp4 videos in 1080p format in Rec.709 color space.

# How are these pages built?

Hugo, a static site generator, is the web framework that builds these pages. The source code for this website is on GitHub. Netlify, the web server, automatically detects changes to the main branch and quickly rebuilds the server. The Hugo theme I use is [FixIt](https://github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt), another open-source project hosted on GitHub. When I make changes or add things to pages, I commit these changes to GitHub, and Netlify builds the new server in seconds.
